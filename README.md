# Algorithm for close range relative navigation of underwater vehicles
In this repository, we present a computer vision algorithm designed to estimate the relative position of a camera in relation to an LED light marker, optimized for observation at short distances in both low-light and bright subaquatic environments.

This algorithm was developed as part of the master thesis of MSc Isaac Alejandro Garc√≠a Briones (). The algorithm
